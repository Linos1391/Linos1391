# About me:
- Hi, the name is Linos and I am a Vietnamese programmer (currently live in the USA).
- I love AI, especially Text generation and Computer vision. Hope that I can build an app for them in the future.
- My favorite language is Python, used to learn C++ but it got rusty by time.
- I know HTML and CSS, but sucks at Javascript. So forget frontend, I hate them.
